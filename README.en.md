# OpenCode Studio

> A customized desktop edition based on [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode)

[简体中文](README.md) | English

This is a personal fork of **OpenCode Desktop** with significant UI polish and quality-of-life improvements. It keeps OpenCode's core capabilities intact while focusing on a better desktop interaction model and a more efficient day-to-day workflow. The `opencode` core itself is mostly unchanged due to the scope of this fork.

## ✨ Highlights
