# Using opencode

opencode validates its own config strictly and refuses to start when a field
is wrong. The shapes below cover the common surface area, but they are a
**summary, not the source of truth**.

## Full schema reference

The authoritative list of every config option — with field types, enums,
defaults, and descriptions — lives in the published JSON Schema:

**<https://opencode.ai/config.json>**

If a field is not documented in this skill, or you need to confirm an exact
shape before writing config, **fetch that URL and read the schema directly**
rather than guessing. opencode validates config strictly, so a wrong shape can
prevent startup.

Independently, every `opencode.json` should declare
`"$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json"` so the user's editor catches
mistakes as they type.

## Applying changes

After saving a configuration change, refresh or reload the affected OpenCode
instance when that path is available. Global configuration has an explicit
refresh path, and UI-managed configuration and command-file edits can refresh
runtime state without restarting the process. If an agent, skill, or plugin
change is not picked up after a refresh, restart the affected OpenCode
instance.

## Where files live

| Scope                         | Path                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project config                | `./opencode.json`, `./opencode.jsonc`, or `.opencode/opencode.json` (opencode walks up from the cwd to the worktree root) |
| Global config                 | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/config.json`, `opencode.json`, or `opencode.jsonc`; `~/.opencode/opencode.json` and `opencode.jsonc` are also scanned for compatibility |
| Project agents                | `.opencode/agent/<name>.md` or `.opencode/agents/<name>.md`                                                               |
| Global agents                 | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/agent/<name>.md` or `agents/<name>.md`; the same directories under `~/.opencode/` are also scanned |
| Project skills                | `.opencode/skill(s)/<name>/SKILL.md`                                                                                      |
| Global skills                 | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/skill/<name>/SKILL.md` or `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; the same directories under `~/.opencode/` are also scanned |
| External skills (auto-loaded) | `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, `~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`                                                    |

Config sources are merged by scope and precedence. Object fields generally
inherit and override earlier values, while some arrays and plugin entries have
dedicated merge or deduplication rules. Unknown top-level keys in
`opencode.json` are rejected with `ConfigInvalidError`.

## opencode.json

Every field is optional.

```json

  "skills": {
    "paths": [".opencode/skills", "/abs/path/to/skills"],

      "description": "...",
      "permission": { "edit": "deny" }
    }
  },

  "command": {

  },

      "enabled": true,

    }
  },

  "plugin": [

  "compaction": { "auto": true, "tail_turns": 15, "threshold": 0.9 }
}
```

Shape notes worth being explicit about:

- `model` always carries a provider prefix: `"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6"`.
- `skills` is an object with `paths` and/or `urls`, not an array.
- `agent` is an object keyed by agent name, not an array.
- `plugin` is an array of strings or `[name, options]` tuples, not an object.
- `mcp[name].command` is an array of strings, never a single string. `type` is required.
- `permission` is either a string action or an object keyed by tool name.

## Skills

opencode's skill loader scans recursively for files named `SKILL.md` inside
skill roots. The folder name is conventionally the skill name, but the loader
uses the frontmatter `name` value and does not require the folder and name to
match:

```
.opencode/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
```

Frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: One sentence covering what this skill does AND when to trigger it. Front-load the literal keywords or filenames the user is likely to say.
---

# My Skill

(skill body in markdown: instructions, examples, references)
```

- `name` is required by the loader. Lowercase hyphen-separated names up to 64 characters are the convention; matching the folder name is recommended but not enforced.
- `description` is optional for loading but strongly recommended for discoverability. Cover both _what_ the skill does and _when_ to use it. Write in third person ("Use when...", not "I help with..."). Front-load concrete trigger keywords and filenames; gate with "Use ONLY when..." if the skill should stay quiet on adjacent topics.
- Optional: `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata` (string-string map).

Register skills from non-default locations via `skills.paths` (scanned
recursively for `**/SKILL.md`) and `skills.urls` (each URL serves a list of
skills).

## Agents

Two ways to define an agent. Use the file form for anything non-trivial.

### Inline (in `opencode.json`)

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "my-reviewer": {
      "description": "Reviews PRs for style violations.",
      "mode": "subagent",
      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6",
      "permission": { "edit": "deny", "bash": "ask" },
      "prompt": "You are a strict PR reviewer..."
    }
  }
}
```

### File

```
.opencode/agent/my-reviewer.md      OR     .opencode/agents/my-reviewer.md
```

```markdown
---
description: Reviews PRs for style violations.
mode: subagent
model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
permission:
  edit: deny
  bash: ask
---

You are a strict PR reviewer. Focus on...
```

The file body becomes the agent's `prompt`. Do not also put `prompt:` in the
frontmatter.

`mode` is one of `"primary"`, `"subagent"`, `"all"`.

Allowed top-level frontmatter fields: `name, model, variant, description, mode,
hidden, color, steps, options, permission, disable, temperature, top_p`. Any
unknown field is silently routed into `options`.

To disable a built-in agent: `agent: { build: { disable: true } }`, or in a
file, `disable: true` in frontmatter.

`default_agent` must point to a non-hidden, primary-mode agent.

### Built-in agents

opencode ships with `build`, `plan`, `general`, `explore`, plus optionally
`scout` (gated on `OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_SCOUT`). Hidden internal agents:
`compaction`, `title`, and `summary`. When Math Mode is enabled, it also ships
hidden `math-orchestrator`, `math-worker`, and `math-verifier` agents. To
override a built-in's fields, define the same key in `agent: { <name>: { ... } }`.

## Plugins

`plugin:` is an array. Each entry is one of:

```json
"plugin": [
  "opencode-gemini-auth",            // npm spec, latest
  "opencode-foo@1.2.3",              // npm spec, pinned
  "./local-plugin.ts",               // file path, relative to the declaring config
  "file:///abs/path/plugin.js",      // file URL
  ["opencode-bar", { "key": "val" }] // tuple form with options
]
```

Auto-discovered plugins (no config entry needed): any `*.ts` or `*.js` file in
the `plugin/` or `plugins/` directory of a loaded config root, such as
`.opencode/plugin/` or `.opencode/plugins/`.

A plugin module exports `default` (or any named export) of type
`Plugin = (input: PluginInput, options?) => Promise<Hooks>`. The export is a
function, not a plain object literal, and the function returns an object
(return `{}` if there is nothing to register).

```ts
import type { Plugin } from "@opencode-ai/plugin"

export default (async ({ client, project, directory, $ }) => {
  return {
    config: (cfg) => {
      // cfg is the live merged config; mutate fields here.
    },
    "tool.execute.before": async (input, output) => {
      // mutate output.args before the tool runs
    },
  }
}) satisfies Plugin
```

Callback hook surface. Hooks return `Promise<void>`; hooks with an `output`
argument may mutate that output in place:

- `dispose()`: cleanup when the plugin is disposed
- `event(input)`: every bus event
- `config(cfg)`: once on init with the merged config
- `chat.message`, `chat.params`, `chat.headers`
- `assistant.response.before`, `assistant.response.after`
- `tool.execute.before`, `tool.execute.after`
- `tool.definition`
- `command.execute.before`
- `shell.env`
- `permission.ask`
- `experimental.chat.messages.transform`, `experimental.chat.system.transform`,
  `experimental.session.compacting`, `experimental.compaction.autocontinue`,
  `experimental.text.complete`

Special object-shaped (not callbacks): `tool: { my_tool: { ... } }`,
`auth: { ... }`, `provider: { ... }`.

## MCP servers

`mcp:` is an object keyed by server name. Configured servers are discriminated
by `type`; the legacy `{ "enabled": false }` form is also accepted when
disabling an inherited server:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "playwright": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["npx", "-y", "@playwright/mcp"],
      "enabled": true,
      "environment": { "BROWSER": "chromium" }
    },
    "github": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "https://...",
      "enabled": true,
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${GITHUB_TOKEN}" }
    },
    "old-server": { "enabled": false }
  }
}
```

`command` is an array of strings. For a configured server, `type` is required.
Use `enabled: false` to disable a server inherited from a parent config.

## Permissions

```json
"permission": {
  "edit": "deny",
  "bash": { "git *": "allow", "rm *": "deny", "*": "ask" },
  "external_directory": { "~/secrets/**": "deny", "*": "allow" }
}
```

Actions: `"allow"`, `"ask"`, `"deny"`.

Per-tool value forms: `"allow"` shorthand (treated as `{"*": "allow"}`), or an
object `{ pattern: action }`. Within an object, **insertion order matters**.
opencode evaluates the LAST matching rule, so put broad rules first and narrow
rules last.

`permission: "allow"` (a string at the top level) is shorthand for "allow
everything" and is rarely what the user wants.

Common permission keys include `read, edit, glob, grep, list, bash, task,
external_directory, todowrite, project_task_create, project_task_list,
project_task_get, project_task_mount, project_task_update,
scheduled_task_create, scheduled_task_list, scheduled_task_get,
scheduled_task_update, scheduled_task_delete, scheduled_task_run_now,
scheduled_task_runs, question, im_list, im_read, im_send, im_watch, webfetch,
websearch, codex_consult, claude_consult, grok_consult, dsh_consult,
repo_clone, repo_overview, lsp, doom_loop, skill, and `plan_exit`, plus any
custom tool IDs. Action-only keys include `todowrite`, all `project_task_*`
and `scheduled_task_*` keys, `question`, all `im_*` keys, `webfetch`,
`websearch`, the consult keys, and `doom_loop`; they do not accept
per-pattern objects.

`external_directory` patterns are filesystem paths (use `~/`, absolute paths,
or globs like `~/projects/**`).

Per-agent `permission:` overrides top-level `permission:`. Plan Mode lives on
the `plan` agent's permission ruleset (`edit: deny *`).

## Escape hatches

When a user's config is broken and opencode won't start, these env vars help:

- `OPENCODE_DISABLE_PROJECT_CONFIG=1`: skip the project's local `opencode.json`
  and start from globals only. Run from the project directory, opencode loads,
  the user edits the broken file, then they restart without the flag.
- `OPENCODE_CONFIG=/path/to/file.json`: load an additional explicit config.
- `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT='{"$schema":"https://opencode.ai/config.json"}'`:
  inject inline JSON as a final local-scope merge.
- `OPENCODE_DISABLE_DEFAULT_PLUGINS=1`: skip default plugins.
- `OPENCODE_PURE=1`: skip external plugins entirely.
- `OPENCODE_DISABLE_EXTERNAL_SKILLS=1`,
  `OPENCODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_CODE_SKILLS=1`: skip the external skill scans under
  `~/.claude/` and `~/.agents/`.

## When proposing edits

- Validate against the schema before writing; use the full schema reference
  above whenever this skill does not cover a field's exact shape.
- Preserve `$schema` and any existing fields the user did not ask to change.
- For agent, skill, and plugin definitions, prefer creating new files in the
  correct location over inlining everything in `opencode.json`.
- If the user's existing config is malformed, point them at the env-var escape
  hatches above so they can edit from inside opencode without breaking their
  session.
- After saving a config change, refresh or reload the affected instance when
  supported. Restart it only when the changed resource is still not visible
  after refresh.
